# WhirlTube Bug Report\n\n## Summary\nThis report documents bugs and issues encountered in WhirlTube v0.4.2. These should be addressed for improved stability and usability. The report is intended for analysis by another AI or developer.\n\n## Previous Runtime Error\n- **Error in ShortcutsWindow**: In `src/whirltube/window.py`, line 437, in `_on_shortcuts`: `AttributeError: 'ShortcutsWindow' object has no attribute 'add'`. ShortcutsWindow uses `set_child()` instead of `add()`. This causes the app to crash when opening Keyboard Shortcuts from the menu.\n\n## User-Reported Issues\n1. **No Thumbnails**: Thumbnails are not loading or displaying in search results or video rows. Placeholder \"No thumbnail\" appears instead.\n\n2. **Follow Tab Shows Nothing**: The subscriptions/feed tab (accessed via \"Feed\" button) displays no content, even when channels are followed.\n\n3. **Search Input Locked During Loading**: While videos are loading after a search, the search text input bar cannot be changed or cleared.\n\n4. **Open Button Behavior in Normal Tab**: Clicking \"Open\" on videos in the normal search tab navigates to the channel instead of playing the video. No direct play option is available in this context.\n\n5. **Download Crashes the App**: Attempting to download a video causes the application to crash. Likely related to yt-dlp integration or progress handling in `downloader.py` or `download_manager.py`.\n\n6. **Filters Do Nothing**: Search filters (duration, upload date, order) in the filters popover have no effect on search results. The `normalize_search_filters` function or provider integration may be faulty.\n\n7. **Copy URL/Title Doesn't Work (GNOME/Wayland)**: Copy URL and Copy Title buttons fail to copy to clipboard, at least on GNOME/Wayland. Issue with `Gdk.Display.get_clipboard().set_text()` in Wayland environment.\n\n8. **Too Many Buttons**: The UI in result rows has excessive buttons (Play, Download, Related, Comments, Open Channel, Open in Browser, Copy URL, Copy Title). This overcrowds the interface and needs simplification (e.g., context menu or fewer primary actions).\n\n9. **Open URL Dialog Searches Instead of Opens**: The \"Open URL\" dialog treats input as a search query rather than directly browsing/opening the provided YouTube URL.\n\n## Recommendations\n- Prioritize crash fixes (shortcuts, download).\n- Verify thumbnail loading in `ResultRow._load_thumb` with proxy handling.\n- Test clipboard operations on Wayland.\n- Review navigation and button logic in `window.py` for play/open behaviors.\n- Ensure filters propagate correctly to `YTDLPProvider.search` or `InvidiousProvider`.\n- Simplify UI by grouping actions into a menu.\n\n## Environment\n- OS: Linux (GNOME/Wayland)\n- Date: Sunday, September 28, 2025\n- Project: WhirlTube v0.4.2\n- Snapshot: See updated `code_snapshot.txt` for full codebase.
